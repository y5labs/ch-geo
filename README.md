# ClickHouse Geographic Information System (GIS) Engine

## What's working
We can deliver world coordinate points and lines that have data attached to a map visualisation framework that can use the data to plot colour, text, etc.

## Todo
- quadkey clickhouse querying for counts (summary)
- quadkey clickhouse querying for sampling
- quadkey clickhouse querying for explicit features
- basemap design customisation to match AA
- implement into AA (epic)
